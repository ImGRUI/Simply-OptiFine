# ‚öôÔ∏èSimplyFine

SimplyFine (**SIF** for short) is a changed version of [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) modpack, that brings **All OptiFine Features** with maximum optimization. It contains only SO mods and OptiFine-Features mods. SIF also includes SO configs for the best performance.

## ‚ùì Differences between Additive

[Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) modpack based on [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), not SO. SO is more experimental and faster than Adrenaline. 

The **biggest difference** is that <u>SimplyFine only adds Optimization and OptiFine Features</u>, without adding anything extra - you are expected to add any other mods you need.
